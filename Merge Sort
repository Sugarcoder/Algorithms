# Divide & Conquer: 
# Divide a big problem into smaller problems, solve it and bring it back together. 




# Sorting algorithms:

# Selection Sort

# Insertion Sort

# Bubble Sort




# Sorting Problem:

# Input: array of numbers, unsorted
# Output: array of numbers, sorted in increasing numbers





# Merge Sort example:

# 57461625
# Recursive algorithm (5746, 1625) -> (7456, 6215)  = split it in half, solve recursively and then merge it back together.
